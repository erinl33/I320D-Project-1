    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)  \n",
    "**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle  \n",
    "**File:** `data.csv`  \n",
    "**Target Variable:** `diagnosis` (M = Malignant, B = Benign)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, affecting about 2.3 million women annually according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these variables is crucial for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems\n",
    "- Early detection of malignant tumors\n",
    "- Reducing unnecessary biopsies\n",
    "- Supporting clinical decision-making in oncology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains **30 numeric features** organized into three measurement types for each of **10 characteristics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Suffix | Meaning | Description |\n",
    "|--------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| `_mean` | Mean | Average value across all nuclei in the image |\n",
    "| `_se` | Standard Error | Variation in measurements |\n",
    "| `_worst` | Worst/Largest | Mean of the three largest values |\n",
    "\n",
    "The **10 cell nuclei characteristics** measured are:\n",
    "- **radius** - mean distance from center to points on the perimeter\n",
    "- **texture** - standard deviation of gray-scale values\n",
    "- **perimeter** - boundary length of the nucleus\n",
    "- **area** - area of the nucleus\n",
    "- **smoothness** - local variation in radius lengths\n",
    "- **compactness** - (perimeter² / area) - 1.0\n",
    "- **concavity** - severity of concave portions of the contour\n",
    "- **concave points** - number of concave portions of the contour\n",
    "- **symmetry** - symmetry of the nucleus\n",
    "- **fractal dimension** - \"coastline approximation\" - 1\n",

    "Answer these questions based on your research (you may need to use Google):\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What is nuclear pleomorphism and why is it important in cancer grading systems like the Nottingham grading system? How does cell symmetry relate to pleomorphism?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: \n",
    "Nuclear pleomorphism refers to the variation in size, shape, and appearance of cell nuclei. In normal tissue, cells have uniform, regular nuclei, but cancer cells often show marked variation and irregularity. This is important for cancer grading systems like the Nottingham grading system as it evalues three components: tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and miotic count. Nuclear pleomorphism is scored on a scale of 1-3, with 1 indicating a small and uniform nuclei with regular outlines and 3 indicating marked variation with large and irregular nuclei. Higher scores correlate to more aggresive tumors.\n",
    "Cell symmetry on the other hand is inversely related to pleomorphism as pleomorphic nuclei are asymmetric, but more symmetric values suggest regular benign cells. But symmetry can be a quantitative measure of one aspect of nuclear pleomorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is the biological basis for why cancer cells often show asymmetry? How do abnormal cell division and chromosomal instability contribute to irregular cell shapes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer:\n",
    "The biological basis for cancer cell asymmetry include abnormal cell division, chromosomal instability, loss of nuclear envelope integrity, altered nuclear organization, dysregulated growth singals. These molecular and cellular defects combine to porduce the asymmetric, irregular nuclear shapes that are charactertistic of malignancy and can be quantified by summetry measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Explain what the symmetry measurement in this dataset captures mathematically. How is symmetry calculated from the cell nucleus contour?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: The symmetry measurement quantifies the difference between a cell nucleus and its mirror image. It captures how much the nucleus deviates from a perfect mirror symmetry image. This is done though tracing the cell nucleus boundary and creating a closed contour, givng a set of x,y coordinates outlining the nucleus. Then the major axis is found by identifying the longest line that can be drawn through the nucleus, allowing for the axis of symmetry to be made to compare the mirror reflection when the contour is reflected across the axis. The original contour is then compared to its mirror image and the symmetry is calculated with the length difference between corresponding perpendicular lines from the major axis to the contour on each side or by standard deviation of the length differences. The measurement is then put on a scale where lower values indicate more symmetry while higher calues indicate more asymmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)? How do shape and symmetry features factor into the BI-RADS classification of breast masses?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: BI-RADS is a standardized classification system developed by the American College of Radiology for reporting breast imaging findings from mammogrpahy, ultrasound, and MRI. Shape and symmetry factor into BI-RADS thorugh mass shape descriptors (oval/round versus irregular), mass margin (circumscribed, microlobulated, obscured, indistinct/ill-defined, spiculated), and symmetry considerations (bilateral symmetry, asymmetry, mass asymmetry).\n",

    "Your answer: Highly Symmetric has 26 tumors (4.6%), Symmetric has 180 tumors (31.6%), Mildly Asymmetric has 247 tumors (43.4%), Asymmetric has 103 tumors (18.1%), and Highly Asymmetric has only 13 tumors (2.3%). The majority of tumors (43.4%) fall in the Mildly Asymmetric category, suggesting that mild irregularity is the most common finding in this clinical dataset. Very few tumors fall at the extremes, with only 4.6% being Highly Symmetric and just 2.3% being Highly Asymmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is the malignancy rate (percentage) for each symmetry category?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: The malignancy rates show a dramatic and consistent upward trend across categories. Highly Symmetric has only 3.8% malignancy, Symmetric has 21.7% malignancy, Mildly Asymmetric has 41.3% malignancy, Asymmetric has 60.2% malignancy, and Highly Asymmetric has 61.5% malignancy. The jump from Symmetric (21.7%) to Mildly Asymmetric (41.3%) is particularly notable, nearly doubling the malignancy rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. At what level of asymmetry does malignancy rate noticeably increase? Does cell symmetry appear to be a useful diagnostic feature?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: The malignancy rate noticeably increases starting at the Mildly Asymmetric category (symmetry_mean >= 0.17), where it nearly doubles from 21.7% to 41.3%. It continues rising sharply through the Asymmetric category (60.2%) before plateauing slightly at Highly Asymmetric (61.5%). The near identical malignancy rates between Asymmetric (60.2%) and Highly Asymmetric (61.5%) suggest that once a tumor crosses the 0.20 symmetry threshold, additional asymmetry does not significantly increase malignancy risk further. Cell symmetry does appear to be a useful diagnostic feature given the dramatic sixteenfold difference in malignancy rates between Highly Symmetric (3.8%) and Asymmetric (60.2%) categories. However, it cannot be used as a standalone diagnostic tool since 41.3% of Mildly Asymmetric tumors are still benign, and even in the highest asymmetry categories, a meaningful proportion of tumors remain benign.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Why might highly asymmetric cells be more likely to be malignant? (Think about how cancer cells divide and grow differently from normal cells.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: Highly asymmetric cells are more likely to be malignant because cancer cells divide and grow in fundamentally different ways compared to normal cells. Normal cells undergo tightly regulated mitosis, producing daughter cells with consistent, symmetric nuclear shapes. Cancer cells have lost these regulatory mechanisms due to genetic mutations, leading to chaotic and uncontrolled division that produces irregular, asymmetric nuclei. Chromosomal instability causes uneven distribution of genetic material during division, resulting in nuclei with varying shapes and sizes. Cancer cells also frequently undergo multipolar mitosis, where three or more spindle poles form instead of the normal two, creating highly unequal cell division and contributing to nuclear asymmetry. Mutations in genes controlling nuclear architecture physically distort the nucleus shape further. The more asymmetric a cell nucleus appears, the more likely it has undergone these chaotic processes that are characteristic of malignancy, making symmetry_mean a biologically meaningful and clinically relevant diagnostic feature.\n",

    "Malignant tumors have a noticeably higher average symmetry_mean (0.1928) compared to benign tumors (0.1742), a difference of 0.0186. While this difference may appear small numerically, it is clinically meaningful because it confirms a consistent pattern across all 569 patients where malignant tumors are systematically more asymmetric than benign ones. This suggests that cancer cells tend to have more irregular, uneven nuclear shapes compared to the rounder, more uniform nuclei typical of benign cells. This shape irregularity in malignant cells reflects the underlying biological reality of cancer, where uncontrolled cell division and chromosomal instability produce nuclei that lack the orderly symmetry seen in normal healthy tissue.\n",

    "### Bonus Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. What percentage of patients in this dataset have malignant tumors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: 37.26% of patients (212 out of 569) have malignant tumors, with the remaining 62.74% (357 patients) being benign, representing a moderate class imbalance of roughly 1.68:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Which feature shows the largest difference between malignant and benign tumors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: Concavity_mean shows the largest percentage difference at 248.6% higher in malignant cases (0.1607 vs 0.0461), making it the strongest discriminator between malignant and benign tumors, followed by area_mean which shows the largest absolute difference at 515.59 units higher in malignant cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Why does class imbalance matter for machine learning classification? (You may need to research this)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: Class imbalance matters because algorithms naturally favor the majority class, meaning a model could achieve 62.74% accuracy by simply predicting every tumor as benign without learning anything meaningful. This is especially dangerous in medical diagnosis where missing a malignant tumor is far more costly than a false positive, so metrics like sensitivity, F1-score, and AUC should be used instead of simple accuracy, and techniques like SMOTE or class weighting should be applied during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. If you were building a diagnostic model, which 3 features would you prioritize based on your analysis? Justify your choices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer: The three features I would prioritize are concavity_mean (248.6% higher in malignant tumors, strongest discriminative power), area_mean (111.4% higher in malignant tumors, clinically validated size indicator), and symmetry_mean (consistent relationship with malignancy shown throughout this entire analysis). Together these three features cover three distinct aspects of nuclear morphology - contour irregularity, size, and shape symmetry - providing complementary information that should yield stronger predictive performance than any single feature alone.\n",

    "## Hints (Read Before You Get Stuck!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One column appears to be entirely empty** (all NaN values)\n",
    "   - Check the last column carefully\n",
    "   - This often happens with CSV exports that have trailing commas\n",
    "   - You should drop this column before analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The diagnosis column uses single letters** - \"M\" and \"B\"\n",
    "   - Don't forget what these stand for when interpreting results\n",
    "   - You may need to convert to 0/1 for some calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symmetry values are relatively small** - typically between 0.1 and 0.3\n",
    "   - Pay attention to the decimal places when creating categories\n",
    "   - Make sure your bin edges are precise\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Continuous features** - most features in this dataset are continuous\n",
    "   - Think carefully about appropriate grouping strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Pro Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `value_counts()` liberally to understand categorical columns\n",
    "- Use `value_counts(dropna=False)` to see if there are any null values\n",
    "- When using `pd.cut()` with custom bins, include `float('-inf')` or `float('inf')` to catch all values\n",
    "- The `describe()` method works best with numeric columns\n",
    "- For comparing groups, `groupby().mean()` is your friend\n",

    "By completing this assignment, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Apply the systematic 10-Point Inspection to a new healthcare dataset\n",
    "2. ✅ Identify and classify feature types (continuous, discrete, categorical, ordinal)\n",
    "3. ✅ Detect and document data quality issues (missing values, unexpected values)\n",
    "4. ✅ Research and document clinical meaning for healthcare variables\n",
    "5. ✅ Create meaningful data groupings based on clinical standards\n",
    "6. ✅ Formulate answerable research questions about cancer diagnosis factors\n",

    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC)  \n",
    "**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle  \n",
    "**File:** `data.csv`  \n",
    "**Target Variable:** `diagnosis` (M = Malignant, B = Benign)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, affecting about 2.3 million women annually according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these variables is crucial for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems\n",
    "- Early detection of malignant tumors\n",
    "- Reducing unnecessary biopsies\n",
    "- Supporting clinical decision-making in oncology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains **30 numeric features** organized into three measurement types for each of **10 characteristics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Suffix | Meaning | Description |\n",
    "|--------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| `_mean` | Mean | Average value across all nuclei in the image |\n",
    "| `_se` | Standard Error | Variation in measurements |\n",
    "| `_worst` | Worst/Largest | Mean of the three largest values |\n",
    "\n",
    "The **10 cell nuclei characteristics** measured are:\n",
    "- **radius** - mean distance from center to points on the perimeter\n",
    "- **texture** - standard deviation of gray-scale values\n",
    "- **perimeter** - boundary length of the nucleus\n",
    "- **area** - area of the nucleus\n",
    "- **smoothness** - local variation in radius lengths\n",
    "- **compactness** - (perimeter² / area) - 1.0\n",
    "- **concavity** - severity of concave portions of the contour\n",
    "- **concave points** - number of concave portions of the contour\n",
    "- **symmetry** - symmetry of the nucleus\n",
    "- **fractal dimension** - \"coastline approximation\" - 1\n",

    "## Hints (Read Before You Get Stuck!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One column appears to be entirely empty** (all NaN values)\n",
    "   - Check the last column carefully\n",
    "   - This often happens with CSV exports that have trailing commas\n",
    "   - You should drop this column before analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The diagnosis column uses single letters** - \"M\" and \"B\"\n",
    "   - Don't forget what these stand for when interpreting results\n",
    "   - You may need to convert to 0/1 for some calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Symmetry values are relatively small** - typically between 0.1 and 0.3\n",
    "   - Pay attention to the decimal places when creating categories\n",
    "   - Make sure your bin edges are precise\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Continuous features** - most features in this dataset are continuous\n",
    "   - Think carefully about appropriate grouping strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Pro Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `value_counts()` liberally to understand categorical columns\n",
    "- Use `value_counts(dropna=False)` to see if there are any null values\n",
    "- When using `pd.cut()` with custom bins, include `float('-inf')` or `float('inf')` to catch all values\n",
    "- The `describe()` method works best with numeric columns\n",
    "- For comparing groups, `groupby().mean()` is your friend\n",
